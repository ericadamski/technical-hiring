## During

---

## Be Empathetic, be honest

  remove barriers, create a vaccum, this is not about convincing them. It is about presenting the problem and asking them if they want a part in solving it.

  <li>Culture</li>

    <li>Potential</li>
    <li>Skills</li>
  </Appear>
</ol>

## How do you screen <span style={{color: '#9A4FEA'}}>Culture</span>?

<Notes>

- values/principles
- make the questions open ended, the more the person can have the chance to expose their personality the better, free speech is one way
- workplace examples/situations that show the use/understanding of that value
- ex. ownership/accountability
  - given a task and a deadline
  - something goes wrong, what do you do?

</Notes>

---

## How do you screen <span style={{color: '#9A4FEA'}}>Potential</span>?

<Notes>

- a little simpler, yet un-measurable
- potential is current knowledge + willingness to learn/grow
- looking at past experiences and being able to retrospect/introspect is very indicative of willingness to grow
- current knowledge does not equat to current skill

</Notes>

---

## How do you screen <span style={{color: '#9A4FEA'}}>Skills</span>?

<Notes>

- up front seems very measurable
- you cannot possibly test for every single skill you need for day to day
- what are we actually looking for? Understanding not memorizing
- testing Deepth of concepts not breadth

</Notes>

---

## Whiteboard

<ul>
  <li>Assess critial thinking</li>
  <Appear>
    <li>Ignore correct solution</li>
    <li>Engage in discussion</li>
    <li>Make people comfortable</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

<Notes>

- I have only ever had to ask two questions
  - maybe could add more :p

</Notes>

---

## Syntax and Language Specific Symantics

<ul>
  <li>Find 1 or 2 deep concepts </li>
  <Appear>
    <li>Ignore 100% correct syntax</li>
    <li>Engage in discussion</li>
    <li>Make people comfortable</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

<Notes>

- if you understand promises well, you probably know a significat amount about the language
- understand that:
  - people are stressed
  - this isn't how you usually work

</Notes>

---

## After

<Notes>

- Expand on notes immediately
- Discuss record and catagorize
  - Culture
  - Potential
  - Skills
- could possible create a lose rubric

</Notes>

---

## ü§ù Post Interiview

---

## Communicate clearly


<Notes>

- leave a good impression
  - leave open dialog
- help people grow
- more empathy
  - interviews are hard
  - they can be extremely useful
  - help people understand what it is that they needed to win
